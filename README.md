Udacity FSWD Project 2

This is the repository for Project 2 of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree:  Portfolio. 

The Portfolio project is a web page modelled on a mockup comprised of the following components:  page title, header, cover image, and four work sample preview images able to be linked to the original work.  

System requirements: all that is required to view this web page is an up-to-date browser (Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, or Google Chrome).

To run this Portfolio web page, simply download the files to a local drive and open file named index.html.  

The Portfolio is a work in progress, and will continue to be modified, developed, and improved, until completion of the course.
